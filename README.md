Introduction

This is a git clone of https://github.com/gshakhn/ideauidesigner-maven-plugin

I modified it to support loading of a Jide license, to be able to use Jide components on UI Designer forms without the
license windows popping up (blocking automatic builds).

All credit goes to original authors of the maven plugin.
